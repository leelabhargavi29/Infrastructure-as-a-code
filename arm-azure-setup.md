Step-by-Step Approach
Part 1: Write the ARM Template for Deploying a VM
Step 1: Set Up Your Environment
Install Azure CLI: Ensure you have the Azure CLI installed on your machine if you haven't already. You can download it from the official Azure website.
Log in to Azure: Use az login to log in to your Azure account and configure your environment for deploying resources.
Step 2: Create the Project Directory
Create a Directory: Create a new directory for your ARM template files (e.g., mkdir arm-azure-vm).
Navigate to the Directory: Change into the new directory (e.g., cd arm-azure-vm).
Step 3: Write the ARM Template (azuredeploy.json)
Create the Template File: Inside your project directory, create a file named azuredeploy.json.
Define the ARM Template:
Parameters: Define parameters for the VM, such as VM size, admin username, password, and the OS image.
Resources: Define resources such as the virtual network, subnet, public IP address, network interface, and the VM itself.
Outputs: Optionally, define outputs to return useful information such as the VM name and public IP address.
Example ARM Template:
Part 2: Commit and Push Changes
Step 4: Initialize Git Repository
Initialize Git: If you havenâ€™t already, initialize a Git repository in the project directory using git init.
Step 5: Create and Switch to a Feature Branch
Create a Feature Branch: Create and switch to a new branch for your ARM template changes (e.g., git checkout -b feature-arm-azure).
Step 6: Add and Commit Changes
Stage the Template File: Add the azuredeploy.json file to the staging area (e.g., git add azuredeploy.json).
Commit the Changes: Commit the changes with a descriptive message (e.g., git commit -m "Add ARM template for deploying an Azure VM").
Step 7: Push Changes to Remote Repository
Push the Branch: Push the feature branch to the remote repository (e.g., git push origin feature-arm-azure).
Part 3: Create a Pull Request
Step 8: Navigate to Remote Repository
Open Remote Repository: Navigate to your project's repository on the hosting service (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
Step 9: Create a Pull Request
Initiate PR: Create a new pull request (PR) from the feature-arm-azure branch to the main branch.
PR Title and Description: Provide a clear and descriptive title for the PR and include details summarizing the changes made (e.g., "Add ARM template for deploying Azure VM").
